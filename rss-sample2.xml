            <title>Oh No! Did Facebook Just Kill Unpaid Marketing Content?</title>
            <description>On June 29, Facebooks algorithm change rocked the content world. The social media giant announced it would start prioritizing posts shared by friends and family over content from publishers and brands. That’s bad news for brands that have come to rely on social media sites like Facebook as a major web traffic driver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Facebook accounts for 41.4 percent of referral traffic to news sites, according to Parse.lys April 2016 Authority Report. But not all is lost. While brands may be in trouble, content published and shared by individuals could gain even greater traction. That’s good news for industry influencers and budding thought leaders.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Exclude Specific Categories from WordPress RSS Feed</title>
            <description>Do you want to exclude specific categories from RSS feed on your WordPress site? Many site owners use some categories for content that they don’t want to appear in the RSS feed of their site. In this article, we will show you how to exclude specific categories from WordPress RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Parsing an RSS News Feed with a Bash Script</title>
            <description>I am involved in several free software projects, including one or two where I maintain the website. For one of those projects, we currently are updating the website. Ours is probably similar to other free software projects. We use a hosting service for several key services, including news, but we run our website on a web server that we own. In our case, we run most of our project on SourceForge and run the website on a third-party service, so the news and website are on different systems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not surprisingly, our project uses an RSS feed to pull news items from SourceForge to display on the project website. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Nextdoor — a private, localized social network — is now used in over 100,000 US neighborhoods</title>
            <description>&lt;i&gt;Two years ago, I wrote a story about Nextdoor, a private social network that requires users to register with proof of both their identity and address. Once accepted, you belong to a neighborhood and can see and speak with any nearby users who have signed up. It&apos;s trying to build a local graph to complement the social graph, and it has quietly grown into one of the largest social networks in the US, with over ten million registered users spread across more than 100,000 neighborhoods.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The former Top Gear crew seem to be embracing the internet in a whole new way. Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond have announced that their new social network, DriveTribe, will be launching this autumn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Details are scarce, but each of the founders shared a quote of what they would like to see from this new venture.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Social Network of Things</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Maintaining assets used to be considered a <i>necessary evil</i>, but manufacturers now see strategic asset management as an important way of delivering value and achieving competitive advantage.<br />
<br />
With the emergence of sensors and novel data collection technologies, we can connect and monitor assets in a way that is light years from the old method of maintenance, which was essentially ‘wait until a machine fails and then fix it’.<br />
<br />
The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled a new paradigm called <i>e-maintenance </i> where assets can be monitored remotely. This enables OEMs to provide innovative maintenance service solutions to their asset users.<br />

            <title>If My Mom Invented a Social Network</title>
            <description>If my mother invented a social network it would be a lot like Pinterest. Thousands of pictures, tons of content, and everyone talking with everyone about everyone else’s favorite things. This social network would consist of people just like my mother, caring, hip, and quickest to the draw when the silence calls for a witty comment.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Line Vs. Facebook And The Future Of Social Networking</title>
            <description>With Lines IPO, I thought this would be a good time to ask about the role that new social networks will play in the larger social network ecosystem. Will they cannibalize Facebook’s usage? Or can we expect to see the biggest players continue to be dominant in social networking?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those of you who don’t know, social networking has a special place in my heart. In 1997, I launched the world’s first online social network called sixdegrees. And as part of that, we wrote a patent that defined a social network as the ability to index multiple relationships in a single database. It gives you the ability to see the people you don’t know through the people you do know.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>This is what happens to your social network accounts after you die</title>
            <description>Facebook has 1.6 billion users. Inevitably, a sizable portion of those people pass away, leaving behind a number of inactive social media accounts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last year Facebook took a major step forward in how to deal with the 8000 plus deceased accounts that appear on the social network each day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its Legacy contact scheme helped make dealing with the death of a loved one easier on the world&apos;s largest social network.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Social Media Response to Nice Was Heartbreakingly Familiar</title>
            <description>In what has become a heartbreaking routine—employed during the Paris attacks of 2015, as well as after recent terrorist attacks in such places as Belgium and Istanbul — people shared emotional memes in solidarity with the city of Nice, where 84 people were killed by a truck driver barrelling into the crowd on the Promenade des Anglais.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using the hashtags #PrayForNice or #JeSuisNice, people expressed solidarity over the deaths of at least 84 people, which French President Francois Hollande says was caused by an act of terrorism. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Mobile users spend little time viewing web content on their mobile browsers, preferring to read most of it through their social networks. As a result, publishers are losing control of their content, and users are overloaded with content sources.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Look at How Social Media is Impacting Divorce Cases</title>
            <description>Most people with a smartphone are constantly tapped into some form of social media. Sharing cute pictures of kids and pets is simply a routine part of life these days. Some people even use social media to vent frustrations or look for advice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a divorce case, however, shares on social media can create ample evidence that can be used against one or both parties to affect alimony, child support, child custody, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Email and Text Messages&lt;br /&gt;
Email and text messages are admissible in court and can even be subpoenaed. If one party in the marriage reveals something about a new job or an upcoming bonus that has not been revealed in court, this can be used as evidence that the person is not being honest in his or her financial declarations.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Subscribe to Reddit Domain Feeds</title>
            <description>One lesser known feature of Reddit is the ability to display all submissions that a domain or site received on Reddit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mentioned this option two years ago for the first time and don&apos;t want to rehash everything I said in the previous article.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may have stumbled upon it accidentally by clicking on the domain link next to submissions that lead to external sites as it will display the feed of that domain directly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The feature is quite useful for a number of reasons. As a webmaster for instance, it is easy enough to check all the direct mentions of your site on Reddit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Five Android apps to feed your RSS needs</title>
            <description>If you are a news junkie, you probably depend on various and sundry RSS feeds—so you most likely need a handy app to curate them into a single, easy-to-use location. Fortunately, plenty of Android apps are available to handle all your RSS needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is RSS?&lt;br /&gt;
For those who are new to RSS, here&apos;s a quick overview. RSS stands for rich site summary (or really simple syndication). It enables sites to publish frequently updated information in a format that is easy to consume (by both apps and humans). The format of RSS tends to be a title and a one-sentence or one-paragraph blurb. Readers can click on the title, which will take them to the original piece.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Different apps offer different features for RSS feeds. I have found five apps in the Google Play Store that I believe represent the best features and the most user-friendly interfaces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Trends to Watch</title>
            <description>Influencer Marketing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the latest Nielson study, over 90% of consumers trust recommendations from friends and family. We have slapped a fancy name on it, but at the end of the day, this is what influencer marketing really is: getting products into the hands of people whom others trust. Peer recommendations have the power to sway buyers and inspire purchase decisions, not because they have a zillion followers or have perfect lips, but because they are reliable, personable sources we believe.</description>

            <title>How to get your Twitter RSS feed using this simple hack</title>
            <description>Twitter has eradicated RSS feeds from its web interface once and for all, following an update to the sites search page today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Twitter launched its redesign late last year it subtly removed RSS feeds for users tweets. And while RSS feeds are still available, you have to be willing to jump through some extra hoops to access them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there was some suggestion that their removal was accidental, but some 10 months&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;later this seems not to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For news, sports, entertainment, online publications and blogs, the benefits of implementing an RSS feed is obvious: Deliver information to your visitors even when they are not actively surfing your site, and they will be sure to come back when an item piques their interest. For other types of businesses, an RSS feed can keep you top-of-mind with your past customers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Top 10 RSS Feeds For Medical News &amp; Alerts</title>
            <description>Health is definitely one of those things we do not notice till it starts to ebb away. Isn’t it also true that medical news is the last thing you like to read or see in newspapers and television? That is, if you do not have any illness in the family. I pray you do not, but if you do then the web has always been a secondary source of some great information. The first source should always be your general practitioner and physician.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no harm in arming yourself with information when you need to talk to a doctor. A better informed patient (or a patients guardian) makes for a wiser decision maker. We are living on the cutting edge of great medical leaps. Medical news and alerts help us to keep pace with these leaps. Let’s look at some top websites for RSS medical news feeds and stay alert with the help of their feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

It does not come as a surprise, when content is evolving as a major source of income for them. By offering high-value content and a trove of inbound links, digital publishers can maximise the profitability of their websites. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Addiction</title>
            <description>I remember a time before Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, emojis, instant messaging and memes. I remember when my friends used to ride their bikes passed my home to see if I was there -- now, we always know where everyone is. Sometimes because it is self-reported (on a social media platform) but also because we can send them a quick text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the term digital native is a little too loose for me, the date range is too baggy around the sides. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Marketing Leaders Should Personally Engage More In Social Media</title>
            <description>&lt;i&gt;I was interviewing Antonio Lucio, the CMO for HP, for my CMO Insight series (see article here), when we started talking about social media. For perspective, Lucio has over 33,000 Twitter followers, has a 62 Klout score, and is the 4th most influential CMO on Twitter (see list here). I asked him why he is so personally involved in Twitter. Very few CMOs tweet and of those who have a lot of followers, few tweet themselves, instead delegating the task to somebody on their marketing team. His response to my question was fascinating, and an important one for any CMO or aspiring CMO to hear.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feds will now check your social media history before granting security clearance</title>
            <description>The federal government has confirmed that it will start targeting social media posts by prospective employees as part of its review process for security clearance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The new policy, which will allow investigators to scan an applicant’s history on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other similar sites, will be adopted soon, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The guidelines make clear that agencies can target publicly available social media posts, if they deem it necessary, but cannot force individuals to hand over their passwords for private accounts, or provide pseudonyms for any profiles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media gives Customers Power over Brands</title>
            <description>Not so long ago, customers were isolated. Their ability to voice their dissatisfaction with the service they received from business was severely limited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The once feared television show Fair Go was just about their only option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today they can air their gripes instantly on Facebook, Twitter or other social platforms and build alliances with similarly disgruntled customers. They can take pictures wherever they go and record or even film their interactions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Are You Paying Enough Attention to Customers on Social Media?</title>
            <description>Although consumers want brands to use social media as a two-way communication channel, the vast majority of businesses are not adhering to those desires, according to a study from social media management software provider Sprout Social. On average, businesses send out 23 promotional messages for every one consumer response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social media is now the No. 1 way consumers interact with businesses. The research revealed that 34.5 percent of consumers turn to social media first when they have a problem, compared with just 16 percent who call and 5 percent who visit a store in person.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Keys to Social Media Success: Curiosity, Conversation, and Patience</title>
            <description>Many investment professionals are naturally competitive people, myself included. Accustomed to being benchmarked and trained to quantify impact, we run an unusual risk of thinking that social media is a contest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But applying that perspective is counterproductive. It is a bit like going to a dinner party and trying to keep score. People might be into it if you have strange friends, but there’s a better chance that you will alienate everyone there.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to use PressForward for content creation</title>
            <description>We live in an age of information overload. With all the stories from news, blogs, social media, and other sources, the amount of information about any given subject can be overwhelming. It is hard enough to keep up when you are just a consumer of information, but what about when you need to curate content for a target audience?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, there are tools that can collect and organize information from a large number of sources, making that task easier. One such tool is the PressForward plugin for WordPress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PressForward is a multi-user, collaborative RSS feed reader that integrates with WordPress&apos; publication work-flow and provides users with the ability to curate content for a target audience. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>It is difficult to get real-time alerts about articles with specific headlines on specific subjects from specific websites. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
News reader applications like Feedly or Flipboard are great for browsing and even searching through news items, but they lack the ability to send notifications proactively.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Emails from Google Alerts can be tardy, and at other times, articles can slip by completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never fear!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Used together, two web applications, IFTTT and Feed Rinse,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;solve this problem easily.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Insanity of Dumping RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>We are a great believer in achieving the widest possible distribution as possible. RSS feeds allow that because they can be easily consumed in many places. RSS was one of the principle ways in which the early bloggers were able to syndicate their content and achieve large scale distribution. To this day, RSS remains one of the best ways to get content onto many people’s screens in as friction free a way as possible.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Since starting the Johnny Bullet comic strip, I’ve begun reading many more web comics than before to the extent that I read more of them than print or digital comics. It has been an interesting transition from one of those comic book store devotee to getting most of my comics from individual creators online. One technology has helped make this transition possible. It is the RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Promote a Blog</title>
            <description>Syndication is conceptually simple. It allows publishers to distribute content that can be displayed in another location or context. Using RSS, publishers are able to easily create and disseminate content feeds that include news headlines, blog summaries and related links. RSS is the defined syndication standard that has become mainstream. All types of information are now available in a syndicated format.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Addicted to Social Media</title>
            <description>Social media is a double-edged sword, providing both benefits and drawbacks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In order to stay connected, many of us are becoming captivated by these pervasive tools. A social media report by Sensis in 2015 reported that nearly half of all Australians access one or more social networking sites every day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The report also found that Australians now spend an average of 8.5 hours a week on Facebook alone, with 24% checking social media more than five times a day. Seven in ten people used a smartphone to access their accounts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 Insider Tips to Rock Your Social Media Presence</title>
            <description>Social media is a blessing for small business entrepreneurs to spread the word about their business without spending a huge amount of advertising dollars. Nevertheless, a majority of small businesses are not able to capitalize on this opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A recent ProOpinion poll found that many small business professionals don’t use social media or a social media calendar on a regular basis. Only 31 percent post frequently on social media, and whats even worse, just 15 percent interact with their audience.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What is New in Social Media Customer Service</title>
            <description>I previously analyzed their 2013 report and their 2014 report and came to the same conclusion each year. Most companies still do not get social media as a customer service channel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Six years ago, I did my own tiny social media study. That is back when the Starbucks Twitter profile said that some guy named Brad did the tweeting. Things are pretty much the same as even back then. (Except for Brad. I am not sure what happened to him.)&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Complex Link Between Social Media and Depression</title>
            <description>The more time young adults spend using popular social media, the greater the link to depression, new research suggests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The finding stems from research—which involved nearly 1,800 men and women between the ages of 19 and 32—that tried to get a handle on how depression and social media habits may interact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But does greater involvement with social media actually promote depression? Or, are people who are already depressed simply more likely to gravitate to social media? The jury, according to the study authors, is still out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>After you have you social media profiles up and running, you may forget to pay attention to your profiles. It is easy to do as you are focused on posting, tweeting, and uploading videos. However, in order to maintain a positive image on social media networks a bit of maintenance is required.

            <description>Social media is not always an online distraction or procrastination platform. While some may be addicted to their social media networks, it is one of the best ways to stay informed. Major news outlets, corporations and persons of interest use social media to deliver messages to the masses. With items posting immediately, the public stays informed. Some issues cause controversy, but social media does more good than harm in retrospect.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Matters</title>
            <description>When it comes to online reviews, business owners take the good with the bad. Reviews can be highly influential. On the upside, positive reviews highlight things such as terrific customer service, stellar products, delicious food and the like. There is a local Facebook group for Kansas City foodies, and a positive review of a new restaurant can be a major boon to a new local eatery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the flip side, even the most customer-focused and conscientious of businesses will eventually get a less than favorable review. It’s simply the law of averages. Reviewers definitely do not lack places to post their comments: Traditional review sites like Yelp are always in play, but people also take to Twitter and Facebook to air grievances.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 ‘90s Social Media Sites From Before Social Media Was A Thing</title>
            <description>I know we think of social media as being a new millennium thing — but the truth of the matter is that the seeds of what would become the social networks we know, love, and sometimes hate today have been around for a heck of a lot longer than the mid-2000s. And these 90s social media sites from before social media was a thing? They are proof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the sites on this list were originally founded in the late 90s, so I suppose we might also be able to consider them social networks from the early 2000s; after all, that’s probably when a lot of us actually started using them. &lt;br /&gt;

Social media is one of the exemplifications of the problem. That is not to say that everyone on social media is a narcissist, but it is where these people tend to hang out.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>What Are RSS Feeds?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RSS Feeds&lt;br /&gt;
RSS also known as rich site summary or real simply syndication, arrived on the scene a number of years ago, but was only recently embraced by webmasters as a means to effectively syndicate content. RSS Feeds provide webmasters and content providers an avenue to provide concise summaries to prospective readers. Thousands of commercial web sites and blogs now publish content summaries in an RSS feed. Each item in the feed typically contains a headline; article summary and link back to the online article.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The U.S. Digital Registry was announced Jan. 29 as a one-stop shop for the social networking needs of government departments who are actively engaged on such platforms as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unlike official government websites that end with .gov or .mil, profiles created through third-party platforms can often look deceptively authentic, but are used to mislead the public and steal personal information.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kids, Safety and Social Media</title>
            <description>For better or worse, we are all on high alert about the whereabouts of children, even those who are not our own. Adults who saw a creepy looking 18-year-old at a coffee shop sweet-talking an underage girl would become suspicious and some might even contact the authorities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And certainly parents today — who sometimes go to the lengths of attaching GPS devices to their kids backpacks and tracking them using cellphone apps — would never allow an adult male to have regular unsupervised contact with their young daughters. But it happens regularly through social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Lately, Facebook newsfeeds have been seeing a new page pop up asking for assistance from the community, and the response has been abundant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jessica Williams, chief probation officer and program director of the Ross County Probation Department, created a Facebook page for the agency a few weeks ago. She started posting names of people wanted on warrants after violating the terms of their probation, along with their pictures.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Jump Start your Company’s Social Media Strategy</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Whether you’re new to social media or a pro, an effective social media program can broadcast&nbsp;&nbsp; both your company and employment brand. It may also help stock your sales funnel. <br />
<br />
Tackle these four fundamentals and you’ll be off and running.<br />
<br />
#1: Start with a clear-cut strategy.<br />
<br />
A clear social media strategy can help maximize your efforts from the outset. Start with your goals: <br />
<br />
Identify your top priority and focus on it. <br />
Who do you want to reach? How do they use social media?<br />
Do you want to drive traffic to your website or store -- or both? <br />
How can community engagement help support these goals? <br />

            <title>Social Media and the Internet will Help your Business Grow</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[The greatest change over the last few years in promotion and advertising is the use of the Internet.<br />
<br />
Our websites are a platform to blog and promote our business. In addition links to social media are vitally important.<br />
<br />
The use of Twitter and Facebook has grown considerably – every business, no matter what size, can enjoy the benefits of social media.<br />
<br />
We have focussed on Twitter and Facebook a lot over the last 12 months. Gradually we have increased our activity and developed what we think works best for us.<br />
<br />
On Facebook we have a business page. We regularly post technical articles about current accounts and taxation topics. These prove popular and often result in questions and contact from current clients.<br />

            <title>Is Social Media Changing The Way We Think About Lawsuits?</title>
            <description>One of the first things some people do after a major life incident is to post on social media, and sometimes those life incidents are rather personal for such a public venue. This has repercussions in two different ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, people create their own liability by posting online. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Slow Feeds organizes your subscriptions into different lists. Theres a stream for low-volume sites that do not update terribly often (sites that update, weekly, for example, but when they do, you want to read them), a stream for the remaining high-volume sites that you can check more regularly, a stream specifically of the most-linked webpages in your feeds, and even a special feed just for articles you have starred to save for later, or review in order which is great if you are starring a bunch of articles on a specific topic, for example..&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Ignorance is Bliss for Legal Bloggers and Publishers</title>
            <description>Even though legal publishers, both law firms and traditional media, put a lot of time and effort into publishing, their publishing platforms are often outdated, deficient or broken. Worst of all, the publishers have no idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like many people I use Feedly, a news aggregator, to stay abreast of news, information, developments and commentary. Others use Manzama, Zama, Flipboard or corporate-installed news aggregators. I liberally share what I read directly from Feedly to Twitter, and to a lesser extent Facebook and LinkedIn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social sharing like this is how news moves today, lots of people read and share. We call it social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the items shared are shared by a select group within particular industries. They are called the influencers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Munch is a fast efficient RSS Reader for Android</title>
            <description>Feeds are added one after the other to Munch which is the program&apos;s greatest shortcoming, especially if you have an opml file full of feeds already that you would like to import.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This means that you need to add feed after feed manually in the application which is a problem considering that you need to get hold of feed urls first somehow to do so.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>LinkedIn for Lawyers: Newly Issued Ethical Guidance Makes Social Media Use Less Risky</title>
            <description>The ethics guidance interpreting &lt;i&gt;Attorney Advertising&lt;/i&gt; rules in the social media context continues to evolve, but this time the evolution appears to be for the better, taking into account the realities of the growing use of social media. As you may recall, early last year, the New York County Lawyers Association weighed in on the ethical implications for lawyers using LinkedIn and suggested that attorneys using the self-proclaimed &lt;i&gt;Worlds Largest Professional Network&lt;/i&gt; needed to beware that their posts on that site, even the most casual, did not run afoul of the attorney advertising rules. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The social network is testing multiple News Feeds inside its mobile app, as the feature is live for select users. In addition to the main feed, tabs for specific topics like Style, Travel and Headlines line the top of the interface. When you select one, the feed is distilled down to relevant posts from your friends and Pages you follow. Facebook says the feature is in the testing phase, so it could be a bit before it is open to all users.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The RSS feed is really something we see as more of a technical help to crawl and index the content a bit better.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So if you have a website that is changing content fairly quickly, a news website, a blog with a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;lot of new content, maybe even a shop that has lots of new content, then the RSS feed really helps us stay on top of things so we can pick up on all of those new URLs and crawl them as soon as we can.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Revamping Your Social Media Sites for the New Year</title>
            <description>The end of the year is drawing near, which means its time for fresh starts and new beginnings. While that does apply to whichever New Year’s resolution you plan to make in 2016 (and, in all likelihood, abandon by February), it applies to social media sites as well. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Unfriend and Unfollow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new year is the perfect time to go through your friends list with a fine-toothed comb. Here is a quick guide for whether you should be friends with someone online: Do you know who this person is? Have you seen him or her in the last year? Do you honestly think you’ll need to talk to him or her in the future?&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The 4 well established steps of a social media audit include the following;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Review your Social Media profiles&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where are you present?&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing to start from is mapping your social media presence. Locate all the social media accounts for your brand and write down the current status and audience size. This is a a great base to evaluate your presence on each platform at a later stage. Here’s an example from a recent social media audit for Twitter Counter.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Android does not have a built-in RSS widget for your home screen. For that, we have to turn to the Google Play Store.

            <description>Facebook has released a new application called Notify that will allow its users to receive push notifications about breaking news, new movie trailers, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The move into real-time news is significant because could help Facebook achieve two goals: It could make the company more important to the media, and it could increase the traffic it sends to publishers. Now, whether the app will be successful or just something that clogs up your phones notifications feed is another set of questions all together.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Social media allows you to connect with the world, but many seemingly harmless quizzes and games can really be traps laid by social media hackers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The simple and sometimes silly surveys that pop up on Facebook feeds often ask simple questions that may appear simple enough: What&apos;s your favorite color? Where did you grow up? What is your spirit animal? Where did you go to high school?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Using Social Media for Public Good</title>
            <description>A man suspected of a double murder was on the run, and a lot of people turned to the Knox County prosecutors Facebook page to find out about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Posts about the killings of Sandra Lee Stelk and Jaime Barber — who were found shot to death in a rural Knox County home on Sept. 30 — and about suspect Travis Bonham were each shared hundreds of times and reached more than 100,000 people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was good news to Prosecutor Chip McConville and his legal assistant and communications manager, Emily Morrison, who have worked since January to find ways to use social media that are helpful to the public.&lt;br /&gt;

                <![CDATA[Question for you to answer: What is YOUR goal for your business startup?<br />
<br />
I cannot stress enough the importance of knowing the answer to that question. A defined goal helps your team plan strategic & measurable steps; while, in the process, you also keep resources in check as you strive to reach it.<br />
<br />
It can be used as a tool to achieve either of these goals:<br />
<br />
increased email subscribers<br />
grow profitability<br />
get leads<br />
more website traffic to your website<br />
improved customers service<br />
increased brand awareness<br />
…and more!<br />

            <title>How to use Social Media to Create Happy Employees</title>
            <description>Did you know companies with happy employees outperform their competition by 20 percent?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
LinkedIn has carried out research to say that 58 percent of employees are proud of their company and are glad to tell others about it, especially on social media. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is great news, as happier employees means happier customers, because they pass on their energy &amp; passion in everything they do, including customer support. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But how can you create happy employees on social media? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>There Is Nothing Virtual About Building Relationships on Social Media</title>
            <description>I remember saying that if I could ever figure out how a person could be in two places at once I would retire a billionaire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, I figured it out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because being in two places or more simultaneously is exactly what social media allows us to appear to do. With a nearly endless supply of apps designed to cross-post anything we can enter into a digital device, you would think the impossible had finally been achieved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certainly a lot of innovative people have ensured a comfortable retirement by making that illusion easy to create. But what is it costing entrepreneurs who fall prey to it?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Great Ideas for Blog Posts</title>
            <description>Blogs have increased in popularity because they provide a steady stream of new and unique content. The only issue presented by this quality of blogs is that it may become difficult for those who run blogs to think of interesting and novel posts. If you have jumped on the blogging bandwagon but suffer writer&apos;s block, do not panic: we have created a list of 26 ideas for blog posts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Make it visual. &lt;br /&gt;
Include a photo or other graphic in a blog post to break up the text, attract your reader&apos;s interest, or help illustrate a point. Better yet, talk about the image you have included to further incorporate it into the post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>6 Marketing Lessons from Amazon</title>
            <description>Creative still counts&lt;br /&gt;
When we think of Amazon, we tend to think about deals and shipping. Everyone from your neighbor to your grandparents knows that Amazon probably has the best price on anything you could want to buy, and they know that the companys bread and butter is shipping it to you as quickly as possible. In other words, nearly every consumer out there knows what Amazon is about.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Warren Buffett Teaches Us All How to Use Social Media</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[While there are certainly dozens of insightful takeaways that could be gleaned from Buffetts 50-year career as an investor, I think everyone can benefit from learning more about one of his core principles that have guided him through good times and bad. <br />
<br />
Reputation matters<br />
One of my favorite all-time pieces of advice from Buffett is this: <i>It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'will do things differently.</i><br />
<br />
In many ways, the sheer simplicity and common-sense nature of that statement belies its profound implications for modern-day life. Throughout his career, Buffett has used his reputation sparingly to turn around a failing business or to gain a tactical advantage.<br />

            <title>4 Tools to Display RSS Feed Updates Directly on Your Windows Desktop</title>
            <description>In this article, I am going to cover four of the best tools to deliver RSS feed updates directly to your desktop, either through RSS tickers, or from alert boxes that display feed information right inside and scroll automatically. This way, during your workday, you can just glance over at the streaming updates and if a topic catches your eye, you can click on it and bookmark the article to read later, during your lunch break or after work.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>XML Sitemaps Or RSS Feeds, Atom Feeds? Google Says Use Both For Optimal Crawling</title>
            <description>When it comes to telling search engines about the content on a website, webmasters might be wondering if they should submit sitemaps or just setup RSS or Atom feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Googles answer? Use both.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;For optimal crawling, we recommend using both XML sitemaps and RSS or Atom feeds. XML sitemaps will give Google information about all of the pages on your site. RSS feeds will provide all updates on your site, helping Google to keep your content fresher in its index. Note that submitting sitemaps or feeds does not guarantee the indexing of those URLs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>You Can Have your Ad Blockers, I Will stick with RSS</title>
            <description>RSS has never been fashionable — it is always been a news gathering tool for nerds, not norms. But now, more than two years after the untimely demise of Google Reader, RSS almost feels cool — like listening to vinyl or hating things on Twitter. RSS is a stealthy way to obtain news thats fast, friendly, and free from both ads and trackers. Its ubiquity makes me wonder why anyone bothers with browsers and adblockers at all, especially when mobile.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Is Text Messaging Ruining Our Youth?</title>
            <description>If you have noticed the apparent omnipresence of cell phones, as most of us surely have, it likely will not surprise you that about 86% of the worlds roughly seven billion people have access to a mobile phone, or that 80% of cell phone owners use their devices to send and receive text messages. You may also be unsurprised to learn that the vast majority of texts are sent by teenagers under eighteen, and that the average teen from this group sends over 3,300 texts each month.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>3 Tips for Promoting Your Products on Social Media</title>
            <description>&lt;b&gt;1. Plan around the online and social hit.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Craft your pitches to include elements that readers will want to share on social media. Think about a creative way consumers can engage with your product along with a campaign hashtag. Just as when you include a storyline in a pitch, including decorations on your product’s theme can help editors imagine how to photograph them. This reduces one step of the design process for the publication and gives you additional influence on how your product is presented to the world. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>50 Apps to Improve Smart Phones</title>
            <description>A recent study by market research firm Nielsen claimed that the average person uses 27 apps a month, which sounds like very few considering that Apple and Google’s app stores both have more than 1m apps available. The key, of course, is that the 27 apps can be almost entirely different, depending who you ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some apps do have mass audiences: Facebook and Twitter in the social networking category; WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Snapchat for messaging; Google Maps for getting around; Spotify for music; YouTube for video; Kindle for reading ebooks; Instagram for photo-sharing; and so on.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>An RSS feed is a means to distribute changing web content including blog posts, podcasts, news releases and site updates to related sites, blogs, online publishers and feed subscribers. It allows busy people to get the information they want without having to use email, which prevents the publisher from selling or otherwise providing their contract information to other parties.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>5 Reasons Why Social Media Buttons Hurt Nonprofit Websites</title>
            <description>That little row of social media buttons has become a ubiquitous feature of most websites. After all, it is good to show off that you are social, and that there are channels where you can interact directly with stakeholders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But is your website header or sidebar the best place to show that off?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here are five reasons why having social media buttons on your nonprofits website might do more harm than good:&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Digital Marketing</title>
            <description>We often confuse relevance with creativity. Relevance is not about being cutting edge or participating in the latest fad. When it comes to social media, relevance is about delivering the right message to the right person at the right time through the right channel. Sometimes it is actually easier to understand relevance by looking at what it is not.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Identify Your Best Social Media Influencers</title>
            <description>Social media has become an integrated layer in our lives, available at almost every point in your day and even in space. It is this level of integration in our lives which has also made social media so powerful as a marketing tool and why just about every business has integrated it into their overall marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One important element of social media, if you really want to get the eyes, ears, and mouths of the people really making an impact, is to connect and engage with the influencers of each social platform.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Use in Teens Linked to Poor Sleep, Anxiety</title>
            <description>The pressure to be available 24-7 on social media may lead to poorer sleep quality as well as an increased risk of depression and anxiety in teens, according to a new study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the study, researchers asked 467 teenagers ages 11 to 17 about their use of social media during the day and at night.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Facebook Patents</title>
            <description>Facebook has been experiencing an uptick in terms of its intellectual property holdings in recent years. In 2014, the company was tied with Emerson Electric for 132nd overall with 279 patents issued that year by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, an increase of almost 120 percent over the companys patenting pace the previous year. Facebooks already earned 250 U.S. patents in 2015 according to Innography, making it very likely that the company will post higher patent totals this year. The text cluster provided here shows us that much of the companys recent innovation focuses on social networking, although user interfaces and computing devices were also large areas of focus.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>It seems hard to imagine that the winner of the 2016 Presidential Election will not also win another important race… the social media race. In todays hyper-connected world, the candidate that inspires enough of the population to eventually win the election will likely also have excited enough of the public to &lt;i&gt;follow&lt;/i&gt; her or him on their various social media networks.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Teens who feel a round-the-clock compulsion to participate on social media sites like Facebook or Twitter may pay a price in lost sleep. They may also face a higher risk for depression and anxiety, new research suggests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
British researchers surveyed nearly 470 teens to explore how 24-7 social media participation might affect their emotional health.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>After Years Of Restraint, Facebook Tries Allowing GIFs In Ads And Page Posts</title>
            <description>Facebook refused to fill its site with flashy animated banner ads for a decade. Zuckerberg thought these interrupted the user experience, and could stunt growth. But after reaching near ubiquity and acclimating users to video ads, today the company tells me it’s relaxing its standards and starting to allow businesses to post GIFs as ads and Page posts.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The 15 Social Media Trends that Defined a Generation</title>
            <description>Over the past few years, social media has given rise to a number of crazes that have quickly spread across the web; with the likes of Twitter and Facebook, a trend started in Devon can reach Delaware in a matter of minutes. In the past 5 years, social media trends have got bigger and bigger, and in some cases wackier and wackier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the more absurd trends like Batmanning and Cinnamon Challenge, to those with an underlying charitable cause like the Ice Bucket Challenge, social media trends spread like wildfire. Chances are you will have had at least a handful of trends pop up on your social media feeds over the years.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Create a social network or risk everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the original pitch for Googles Facebook rival, Google+, a refrain hammered over and over by the social network&apos;s chief architect, Vic Gundotra, in meetings with the companys top brass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gundotra, described by colleagues we spoke with as charismatic and politically-savvy, eventually persuaded Larry Page, the Google cofounder who returned as CEO at the beginning of 2011 after a decade behind the scenes, to turn the company upside down for this cause.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Could Deal your Brand a Blow</title>
            <description>Decide how you intend to use social media and to whom you will allow access, especially on Facebook. You do not necessarily need to completely sanitise all your social media profiles — because companies want to hire real people, and some companies specifically look for creativity and personality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, if you want to ensure a potential employer does not reject you on those grounds, make sure your online social profile depicts the type of employee a company would want to hire.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Spread is a Problem for Organizations</title>
            <description>According to the Electronic Transactions Development Agency , a public organisation, Thais usually spend around seven hours a day online and most of that is spent on social media. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This phenomenon has had an impact on many businesses due to the time people are forced to spend on social media, especially content businesses, like news providers, bloggers and websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It has also affected the way people get news and other information, with rumours sometimes mistaken for genuine news reports. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Real Reasons Social Media Affects Your Companys SEO</title>
            <description>The simple act of having a social profile does not do a thing to help rankings. Anyone can create a profile on a social network, any time. Facebook says anywhere between 5.5 and 11.2% of their monthly active users are fake or duplicate accounts, and considering that represents 67.65 million and 137.76 million fake or duplicate accounts, it is easy to see why social &lt;i&gt;presence&lt;/i&gt; does not equate to increased ranking.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The new launch landscape levels the playing field for brands of all sizes and industries when reaching consumers–yet the ability for consumers to share their opinions freely on social media can provide huge hurdles for brand messaging. Consumers can quickly activate other like-minded consumers to rev up the online discussion to a level anywhere from highly positive to tanking a brand.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Importance of XML Sitemaps</title>
            <description>In the early days of search engines, I was not much of a believer in XML sitemaps. But over time, I began to see first hand how they can benefit websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XML sitemaps serve as a way to communicate directly with the search engines, alerting them to new or changed content very quickly and helping to ensure that the content is indexed faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For content publishers, it has become critical to help Google specifically understand if your site is the original publisher of content. Why? Panda.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>In 2014, consumer shopping behavior evolved rapidly. Shopping online and through mobile devices is the new norm, and the experience has become increasingly more social with platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. These platforms, in turn, have launched new commerce capabilities like the &lt;i&gt;buy &lt;/i&gt;button.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Separate the Personal and Professional on Social Media</title>
            <description>n a recent research study, we spoke with dozens of professionals about their use of social media, and were struck by the variety of approaches they are using.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some professionals, we found, still manage to avoid social media altogether. But most see that as unrealistic in many occupations, and are unwilling to be deprived of the advantages social media affords in terms of connecting to people and collecting information.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>When standardized tests are shared nationwide—as they now are, under the Common Core system that&apos;s been adopted in 46 states—cheating suddenly becomes a whole lot easier. Especially since teenagers now share just about everything on social media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Makes You Spend More</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<i>When I ran a Facebook ad recently for a nonprofit where I volunteer, I was surprised how specific you could get in targeting potential customers. If I wanted to advertise the event I was promoting to women between the ages of 24 and 26 in my city who were unmarried and educated, who watched Girls, owned a dog and liked designer purses — I could do that.</i><br />
<i></i><br />
<i>Being able to target ads to a specific market can help a seller reach the people who want or need their products and services. Unfortunately, that means buyers may also be encouraged to spend more than they should if they are not mindful.</i><br />

            <title>How To Use Social Media To Attract New Clients</title>
            <description>One of the interesting qualities of freelancing work is that you may never meet your clients in real life. Perhaps more than any other job market, freelancers rely heavily on their online image- an aggregate of their resume, portfolio and personality to set themselves apart and attract new clients who may very well be located on the other side of the world.&lt;br /&gt;

For me, it was a lot of watching and waiting, a bit of experimenting, and tons of trial and error. When I first started out on social media, I had just the most basic rules and intuitions. Even now, I feel like I learn a new quirk or quibble on a near-daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Marketing Tools That Build Your Reach and Credibility</title>
            <description>As an early adopter of media since the early 80s, I love everything about media, its immediacy, urgency, fluidity, and ability to impact the masses and unify people and ideas in real time, in the moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Social marketing continues to be a powerful force for good, but as we know it can be a dangerous platform for bad too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through prior careers in entertainment and broadcast radio sales, and celebrating 8 years in my current social media consultancy, social marketing clearly is the most effective way to build branding, credibility and the bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Letting Your Kids Play in the Social Media Sandbox</title>
            <description>After giving it some thought, and seeking counsel from friends who work for social start-ups in Silicon Valley, I called Luca and told him that he could have a YouTube account, but with one big caveat. We would make his account settings private, so that no one could leave comments. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>XML Sitemaps Or RSS Feeds? Google Says Use Both For Optimal Crawling</title>
            <description>For optimal crawling, we recommend using both XML sitemaps and RSS feeds. XML sitemaps will give Google information about all of the pages on your site. RSS feeds will provide all updates on your site, helping Google to keep your content fresher in its index. Note that submitting sitemaps or feeds does not guarantee the indexing of those URLs.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Reduces Stress for Women, But Not Men</title>
            <description>What is social media doing to us? Is it stressing us out with its never-ending pings announcing new baby pictures, engagements, and unimportant messages to respond to? Or is it keeping us connected to people, and therefore happier? These are tricky and loaded questions, but a new survey from Pew adds a bit of evidence to the &lt;i&gt;social media reduces stress&lt;/i&gt; side of the ledger. At least if you are a lady.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Summary Writing Hints and Tips That Get Great Results</title>
            <description>The summary is your hook to get readers to click on your article. Think of the summary as the hot fudge to your article titles ice cream. You can give a headline that states &lt;i&gt;Ice Cream&lt;/i&gt; and it may be enough to turn a few heads, but not likely. Add a quick summary that describes the ice cream in more depth – such as the promise of a creamy, chocolate, mouthwatering, hot-fudge sundae – and you are far more likely to get the attraction you want and need.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Facebooks automated &lt;i&gt;year in review &lt;/i&gt;slideshows are meant to surface highlights from the year that was, but for some the virtual scrapbook simply brings back bad memories. In the case of web designer Eric Meyer, a photo of his recently deceased daughter appeared, surrounded by confetti, illustrations of party goers dancing and the exclamation &lt;i&gt;Eric, here&apos;s what your year looked like&lt;/i&gt;! In response, Eric wrote a blog post about what he refers to as that apps &lt;i&gt;Inadvertent Algorithmic Cruelty&lt;/i&gt;, and pointing to the shortcomings of modern software design.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>People define negative SEO in a variety of ways. Some consider it the malicious efforts of your competitors to either build unsavory links to your website or steal the best links from your website.

            <title>A World of Podcasts</title>
            <description>Podcasting is slowly becoming a huge market branching off from the likes of blogging and social media. Effectively, it is the same as blogging except instead of reading some words and looking at some pretty pictures, you actually hear the tone of voice behind the ideas and innovations. With a podcast you can infact truly determine the depth of the conversation and analyse the angles of communication through an individuals mind set. Reading is a huge global culture. It occurs every day from the sight of morning headline news to the vast pages in a legal document and the lunch menu at a team end-of-month munch-fest. You cannot escape it, even as you stare at the pixels on your laptop screen, text is everywhere. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>7 Social Media Security Tips To Protect Your Business</title>
            <description>Many small businesses recognize the benefits of having a social media presence for customer service and long-term marketing purposes. However, many are slow to recognize social medias security issues and how employees own social presence can add to the companys security issues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some companies restrict internal access. Others may prevent employees from having any corporate association outside of work on their own social platforms. This is due to the fact that whatever an employee says outside of work publicly can have a significant impact on the organization.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>3 Ways to Get Business Recognition on Social Media</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[In our increasingly competitive world -- one in which we clamor for the right kind of attention for our companies -- the pursuit of <i><u>likes</u></i> can become an obsession.<br />
<br />
While experts work to define the return on investment, or ROI, of social-media attention and quantify the financial value of social media-fans and followers, entrepreneurs have an innate sense that there is power in gathering a following of likes for our brands.<br />
<br />
If being liked is an important goal, and if we measure our likeability by what our social-media fans are saying, how can we effectively gather that evidence of our likeability?<br />

            <title>How to Use RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS may be antiquated to some because of the early days of online when RSS readers aggregated content from multiple sources and compiled them into one stream of news and headlines under an RSS reader. It made life easier for people because they did not have to go to dozens of slow Web sites to get their content. Instead, it all flowed to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Web and social media sites became more sophisticated and access speeds became faster, the RSS readers faded away. But the ability of sites to distribute their content to other sites and also collect content from other sites is still viable even today.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcasts and Copyrights</title>
            <description>Podcasting has a very low barrier to entry; all you need is audio recording software and a means of creating an RSS feed, be it through software or manual work. As a result, just about anyone can podcast, and the quality of podcasts is therefore highly variable; there are professional podcasts that rival professional broadcasts in quality, and there are amateur podcasts that can not even be heard clearly. For this reason, copyright infringement leeches, often unwittingly, into a number of podcasts. To produce a successful podcast, it is important to understand and respect Western copyright laws. To help ensure that these things are done, we have compiled some information about podcasts, music, and copyright law. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Experts say the case of a mother accused of poisoning her 5-year-old son to death with salt appears be an example of how social media feeds into Munchausen by proxy, a disorder in which caretakers purposely harm children and then bask in the attention and sympathy.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>A new Y Combinator-backed startup called Roost wants to succeed where RSS readers perhaps failed with the introduction of a new service that lets consumers subscribe to websites using browser-based push notifications. However, unlike a browser plug-in system such as PageMonitor, for example, Roost is based on an upcoming standard for web push, which is built into Safari and is coming soon to Google Chrome and Firefox.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Interesting:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I do not use social media. Some of my friends keep asking me to join social media and interact with them that way. I tell them I consider social media to be a waste of time and that I have more important things to do. Yet they continue bugging me to join social media. What can I tell them to convince them it is better for me not to be on social media?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Can RSS Feeds Help SEO</title>
            <description>Any owner of a website that is marketing or promoting a product or a service is concerned about the amount of traffic it generates. Not only is the concern about traffic, but the quality of the traffic is really the key. If your website does not rank well in the search engines, it can limit the amount of sales that you make, so anything to improve the ranking is welcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One way to achieve a higher visibility is to improve the quality and the amount of relevant content whenever possible. One way to do this is to use RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media and the Law</title>
            <description>Now that folks are posting and tweeting and retweeting - complaints and grievances around the clock, is every negative experience a possible class action? If someone has a bad experience with a bank or someone gets food poisoning at a restaurant or someone has a problem with a prescribed medicine, he can immediately find others with similar outrages. Are social media making it easier for plaintiffs to band together?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Teens, Social Media and the School System: Misunderstood or Toxic Relationship?</title>
            <description>The education system has its flaws. You do not have to be a researcher to know that. Am I biased? Of course I am, but so is everyone else who has ever been to school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The education we have in this country is incredible compared to some countries that do not. I am not disregarding them; I have the perspective of a student who has had the luxury of going to school my entire life and a pretty good one at that. Schools all over the world have flaws. Some are small but some are quite substantial. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Increase Sales on Ebay with RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>As eBay sellers continue to try to crack the code of Cassini, one suggestion coming from the eBay team is to refresh RSS feeds. If you are not familiar, an RSS feed is a technology where a web feed is used to distribute information, or to distribute content to a large number of people at one time. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. eBay sends an RSS feed to Google. Sellers do not have to do anything to make this happen - eBay automatically sends information about each listing to Google using RSS feeds.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Media Making You Stupid</title>
            <description>Social media, we all know, can make you unproductive. If you’re indiscreet or offensive, it can complicate your relationships. But can it also make you downright dumb?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That is what a new study published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface suggests. How can spending more time on Facebook or Twitter end up making us stupider?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Crowd Sourcing and Social Media</title>
            <description>It seems that our society is growing ever more dependent on social media; more and more people are joining social networking giants such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and more such websites and applications are springing up to meet the rising demand for them. As society and culture continue this turn towards technology, so do the operations of society, especially through crowdsourcing. A powerful tool, crowdsourcing does much good, but has also caused a number of problems. In such a situation, one must ask: do the benefits of crowdsourcing really outweigh the risks&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>IBMs the biggest patent holder of all time, and when it comes to defending them, it tries to work things out amicably. That is exactly what is happened with Twitter, after the social giant today announced it has bought 900 patents from Big Blue and entered into a cross-licensing agreement to limit the threat of future lawsuits. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Partial or Full RSS Feeds?</title>
            <description>It seems the opinions are mixed on partial versus full RSS feeds. Full feeds give the recipients complete access to what a blogger has published, with the convenience of never having to visit the actual blog. This can be a problem for the blogger, especially if they were hoping to gain more page views from their RSS feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Facebook on Thursday officially unveiled Paper, a new app created by Facebook Creative Labs, though it did so without any sort of big press event around the new application, which includes tons of content, including your news feed, news articles, photos and more. In other words, it s much more robust than a simple RSS feed replacement to compete with FlipBoard, as earlier rumors suggested it might be.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Track RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>For starters, it is important to understand that you do not need a service for RSS. Your RSS feed already exists without a third party service. The only thing a third party service would do for you is try to help keep track of subscribers. But even without that service, people can still subscribe to your feed.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>6 Months After Google Reader Shut Down</title>
            <description>6 months ago this day Google Reader shut down and the voices of millions of blog posts were suddenly silenced. Although there was a huge outcry before Google reader disappeared, on the actual day it went away it seemed to pass many users by without a word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the reason was that by this time a few groups had come out with alternative apps for the service so it was easy to miss but also many tweets and blog posts had been written venting their frustration. But 6 months on and the picture has changed a lot. The internet (at least for nerds) looks very different than it did before.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Over Sharing!</title>
            <description>In an effort to ensure UK courts can conduct fair trials, the UK Attorney Generals Office will soon start advising Facebook and Twitter users about the dangers of commenting on legal cases. In a world of super-injunctions and tweeted court cases, users have often shared sensitive legal information, believing they are entitled to free speech online. However, Facebook and Twitter posts are subject to the same laws that apply to newspapers and TV media, meaning a status update or a tweet about a case or defendant could go viral, potentially influencing a jury or revealing the names of victims. &lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The first step is to understand that you have very little control over the way in which people discover and come across your content. But once they do — and assuming they are interested in coming back — your responsibility is to give them a multiple-choice selection of avenues by which to do so.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>With more wearable devices entering the market, the way we read online content could change significantly. Instead of taking out a smartphone, readers of the near-future will more often read from devices like Google Glass or the Galaxy Gear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A new service makes it easier for content from RSS feeds and websites to transition to wearable technology. Wearably helps publishers display their content on wearable devices such as smartwatches or Google Glass.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Display RSS Feeds on a Website</title>
            <description>FeedForAll has made available a free PHP program called rss2html.php, which can be used by webmasters to automatically display RSS feeds on their website. The resulting webpage will always show the RSS feed&apos;s most current data. The advantage of using the rss2html.php script is that the resulting webpages contents will always be up to date, and can be easily spidered by search engines. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Do You Manually Add RSS Feeds to Google Play</title>
            <description>By copying the entire RSS feed URL and pasting it into the search box in Newsstand, you can find a box you can add under&lt;i&gt; Feeds&lt;/i&gt;. This method seems to work, although for a couple of sample feeds I got an endless loading loop. Others might not show up at all if the app does not properly detect them.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Turn an RSS Feed into a Google Glass App</title>
            <description>As media companies race to adapt to their readers increased reliance on smartphones and tablets, creating content for the next frontier of devices--bodily extensions like Google Glass and smartwatches--probably falls into the “to do later” category for many publishers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Washington, D.C., startup Silica Labs is trying to change that with Wearab.ly, a platform that turns content from existing RSS feeds into apps formatted for wearable devices. Launched earlier this year as Simple Wing with a Google Glass app for National Geographic, the recently rebranded service has now cornered the D.C. media market with new relationships with NPR and Atlantic Media.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For individuals who are using social media to market their organization, business, cause, etc., pervading every corner of the Internet with generic social media profiles is not the most effective strategy.

            <title>Production and Use of Sound Effects</title>
            <description>Sound effects are artificially created or enhanced sounds that are used in artistic works to emphasize or express an action, mood, or feeling. Sound effects were initially used in radio dramas, but can be observed more often today in podcasts, theater, films, and television shows. They are often synchronized with certain actions, such as a door&apos;s slamming being accompanied by the appropriate noise. Sound effects may also be used in the background of a scene to create anticipation or other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unsurprisingly, the most realistic sound effects tend to be recordings of actual sounds. To create these sound effects, the actual sounds that are recorded may also be edited or enhanced; sometimes, the pitch, intensity, or another aspect of the sound may be altered using software. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Is the goal to drive traffic to the main website in a fashion similar to SEO or paid search? Is the goal to build awareness of your products? Or is the goal something else entirely?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Make Your Own RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>For news, sports, entertainment, online publications and blogs, the benefits of implementing an RSS feed is obvious: Deliver information to your visitors even when they are not actively surfing your site, and they will be sure to come back when an item piques their interest. For other types of businesses, an RSS feed can keep you top-of-mind with your past customers.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google+ RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>RSS feeds are not officially supported by Google Plus yet, that&apos;s bad if you want to follow a specific user on the new social networking site. Sure, you could add the user to a circle to read all&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;messages on the Google Plus website, or visit the stream of that user directly to access the new messages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both options are not really that comfortable, especially if you do not hang out 24/7 on Google Plus. The alternative? You could try a service that turns a stream into an RSS feed&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Feed Advertising</title>
            <description>More companies see the spread of RSS as a great way to get their information to users, and profit from advertising placed within those feeds too. Last October, JupiterResearch noted less than 10 percent of RSS feeds had advertising in them, and no major advertisers were using feeds as part of their marketing strategies.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Paid RSS Tools Market</title>
            <description>It has been a month since Google Reader shut down, breaking users hearts and bringing an end to a nearly eight-year run of RSS dominance. As soon as word came of Readers impending doom, third parties like Digg, Feedly, and others sprung into action, eager to replace the old guard. At the time, they looked like a rescue team, gallantly swooping in to save us from regular old web browsing. But after a month, the squad of reader replacements has turned into a set of regular products trying to keep up with user demands. So how well have these replacements done in Google Reader’s absence?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out it is hard to make an RSS reader. Feedly switched over to its own servers with just a few weeks to spare and Digg launched mere days before Readers lights-out. Newsblur had been running since 2009, but faced a flood of traffic after Google announced the reader shutdown, and founder Samuel Clay describes pulling 14-hour days for months just to keep the site loading in under 100 milliseconds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Future of FeedBurner</title>
            <description>&lt;i&gt;Google has treated Feedburner like a bad impulse buy ever since purchasing it in 2007, leaving it in a state of neglect. After the announcement that Google Reader was being discontinued, the Internet grapevine began buzzing about what Google service was next on the chopping block. The general consensus is that it will be Feedburner, since both the API and Adsense for Feeds have already been closed. It would make sense, if you are a webmaster, to redirect your RSS feed and newsletter subscribers to FeedPress before it&apos;s too late.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>The Feedly RSS service raised half a million dollars Monday, pulling in an average of more than $62,000 in subscriptions each hour over an eight-hour span.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two days ago, Feedly kicked off a paid version of its RSS service by offering $99.99 lifetime subscriptions to the first 5,000 customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later in the day, Edwin Khodabakchian, CEO and co-founder of DevHD -- the company behind Feedly -- said that the 5,000 accounts had been snapped up in eight hours. The total to Feedly: almost $500,000.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Guide to Extending RSS in Drupal</title>
            <description>If you need to provide updated information from your site to external consumers, RSS is generally the go-to standard you use. It provides a well-defined and well-supported definition. Generator and consumer RSS solutions are widely available in pretty much any programming language or web framework out there.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Still More Google Reader Alternatives</title>
            <description>Google Reader closed its virtual doors on July 2nd, becoming one of the largest Google services to get the axe. In the weeks leading up to its closure, several alternative RSS solutions emerged, hoping to win over the millions of people looking for a new Reader. But with literally dozens of entrants, it’s now much more difficult to find the right solution for your needs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have tested all of the top solutions currently available and have selected the four best services for you. These are fully featured solutions, meaning you can manage them both from the Web and from Android or iOS apps. Here are our top four Google Reader alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Simple Way to Create RSS for Twitter</title>
            <description>Twitter has dropped support for RSS Feeds but there does exist a solution, slightly complicated though, that you may use to generate feeds for your various Twitter streams including Twitter search results, user timelines and even Twitter lists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without RSS feeds, it is difficult to use your Twitter data elsewhere. For instance, you can no longer create recipes in IFTTT that get triggered when you post a new tweet. You cannot import your Twitter timeline automatically into your blog. You cannot track Twitter search results for certain keywords in your RSS reader.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mention is Replacing Google Alerts</title>
            <description>We last caught up with Mention back in March, just as it had raised $800,000 to help develop its Google Alerts-esque service for the social Web&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, Mention has set out its stall to &lt;i&gt;reinvent Google Alerts&lt;/i&gt; with a system that allows users to receive real-time mentions – as you would expect – about anything online, across Windows, iOS, Android, the Web and Chrome. Though the service is largely used by companies to monitor mentions of their name, it can of course be used by anyone.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to use IFTTT to Automate</title>
            <description>You may think of the Web as a big tubular mesh of interconnectedness, but really, apps and sites tend to be more like islands than Kumbaya-singing cooperative circles. Evernote does not seamlessly save your notes to Dropbox. The Facebook photos you are tagged in do not automatically post to your Flickr account. Articles you save in Feedly do not push themselves to Pocket for later reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As explained below, IFTTT changes all that, bringing your various Web-service ingredients together into a smart, automatic, and, above all else, connected Internet stew. Yes, IFTTT makes the Web both scrumptious and ridiculously powerful, and we&apos;re going to show you how to brew up some deliciously useful recipes, as well as highlight some awesome IFTTT tasks that others have already created.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Easy Way to Subscribe to Twitter via RSS</title>
            <description>Last month, Twitter unfortunately killed-off RSS feeds for users of the service. Subscribing to your own Twitter feed is a great way to archive your tweets and make them searchable through whatever RSS Reader you’re using. Of course, now that Google Reader, too, has been killed-off, most of the other readers available right now do not have a search feature. However, most are promising to deliver that ability soon.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>As per an update on the 27 June 2013 on the Social Times, Hootsuite one of most popular platforms used by social media managers to efficiently update their accounts has finally launched the Hootsuite Syndicator, an RSS reader that would operate directly from the platform’s dashboard for users of Google Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to the report, the users of Googles dashboard can now display their RSS feed directly from the account and seamlessly share the latest content across multiple social media networks. Those who use Google Chrome would get a special advantage of being able to subscribe to RSS feeds using by the installing the syndicator extension.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feedly Replaces Google Reader</title>
            <description>Feedly&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;launched in 2008 as a sort of alternative skin for Google Reader. Its interface was cleaner and more colorful, although Google Reader provided the engine behind Feedlys content-delivery system. Shortly after Google announced in March that it would shut Google Reader, Feedly declared that it would build its own backend engine; it was implemented in June.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The switch to Feedly may be born of necessity for Google Reader devotees, but it is hardly a sacrifice. Feedlys design and interface are more pleasant and intuitive than Googles, and keeping up with new content on the web is flat-out more fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To add content, hit the search icon at the top right corner of Feedly&apos;s main screen and a menu slides gracefully into view. From here, browse through several topics from among Feedlys featured choices, search for the title of a blog or publication with an RSS feed, or type the URL for the sites RSS feed into Feedlys search box.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Digg Reader Adds Top Requested Features</title>
            <description>Digg Reader, the Betaworks-backed alternative to the now-dead Google Reader, is making progress in becoming a more solidified platform for serious feed reading. Shortly after its launch a couple of weeks ago, it switched on the ability to display unread counts for feeds and folders, and last night, it added two more of users’ top requested features, the ability to view &lt;i&gt;only unread &lt;/i&gt; items and the &lt;i&gt;mark as unread&lt;/i&gt; option.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the grand scheme of things, these are minor upgrades to a long-term roadmap where Digg envisions building a more fully fledged RSS reading experience – not just one that is on par with where Google Reader left off, but one that eventually extends beyond the original feature set to include things like a view into the popularity of posts across your network, advanced social-media sharing capabilities, and of course, the ability to feed posts to Digg.coms front page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google Alerts Gets the Axe</title>
            <description>Google is really bidding a thorough goodbye to everything RSS this week. Not only did the company shut down the popular Google Reader for good on Monday, it has also stopped sending Google Alerts by RSS, according to Search Engine Land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Users who want to be notified by Google Alerts on specific search phrases or topics, but who don’t want the results clogging their inbox, will no longer be able to send them to Google Reader. Since Google Reader is now dead, the search giant is re-directing all Google Alerts that used to show up in your Reader to an email account of your choice. &lt;br /&gt;

At AOL, we have a unique perspective on RSS readers and content aggregation apps because we are a publisher of content as well. Our goal is to create the best possible experience for users who want to read the best content on their phone, tablet, or desktop computer, whenever and wherever they want.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google Graveyard</title>
            <description>Ever since the advent of the internet there have been an untold amount of companies based around web technologies that have come and gone. The dot-com bubble of the 1990s filtered out many of the winners while shedding the losers. Over the years start-ups came and went, were bought, or just failed. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Real Reason Google Wants to Kill RSS</title>
            <description>Interesting article about why Google no longer wishes to support RSS Feeds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;RSS represents the antithesis of this new world: it is completely open, decentralized, and owned by nobody, just like the web itself. It allows anyone, large or small, to build something new and disrupt anyone else they would like because nobody has to fly six salespeople out first to work out a partnership with anyone elses salespeople.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>RSS for Twitter is something I&apos;ve used for search subscriptions myself. Following different search personalities or saves queries and subscribing to them via RSS is a feature I enjoyed and benefited from. No longer.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Betaworks, the company that bought news site Digg last summer for $500,000, launched its eagerly anticipated Reader app today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Digg Readers launch comes less than a week before Google is slated to kill its beloved Google Reader product, which pulls in news feeds from just about every news site on the Web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Digg works much the same way. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>10 Google Reader Alternatives</title>
            <description>Google Reader is on its deathbed, slated to meet its end on July 1st. Its demise has been looming in the distance for a while, so this should come as no surprise. And while this is certainly a time of mourning, there&apos;s the unseemly business of finding a replacement. Here is a list of platform agnostic alternatives that should help make the transition as painless as possible.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS Reader Comparison</title>
            <description>Feedly, one of the most popular RSS readers, has added functionalities to replace some of the actions users used to be able to do with Google Reader, like hosting feed subscriptions and offering a fully functional IFTTT channel. Digg will soon launch its own freemium-model reader this week, and AOL recently joined the club by releasing their own RSS reader.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Dozens of smaller tech names are also promoting their services; it is a mad house out there in the RSS world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With so many companies pushing their tickets into your hands, how can you decide which RSS train to ride? &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>If Google Can Not Get RSS to Work Why Are Others Trying?</title>
            <description>For anyone who has not been following this with pathological focus, here is the quick version: An RSS reader is a way to pull in feeds of articles from various websites, and people who revel in information overload love them. Google created one, called Google Reader, six years ago, and as it was state of the art at the time, it essentially took over the market. But then Google decided that several million news junkies were not worth its time, and on March 13 said it was getting out of the RSS business, opening the door to a handful of new companies to get in. The climax comes next week, when Google flips the switch and casts out its RSS enthusiasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some might interpret the fact that one of the Internets largest, richest companies abandoned this idea as a red flag. Not Feedly, Digg, AOL, Newsblur, and others, which are quickly developing their own readers to fill the Google Reader vacuum. It is not that they believe everyone wants to immerse themselves in an endless sea of headlines. Instead, they are betting that the technology will open up larger news-reading markets.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feedly Launches Cloud Service</title>
            <description>Feedly is a service that has risen in popularity recently for the most part because the much-loved RSS service Google Reader is coming to close on July 1, but the company is definitely doing its best to make a space for itself as something more than just an alternative. Today, Feedly released the Feedly Cloud, which not only creates a standalone web-based RSS reader app, but also hooks all of your feeds into the cloud, which developers can then hook their own APIs into for various purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feedly Partnerships</title>
            <description>Feedly is quickly becoming one of the most robust and feature rich alternatives to Google Reader. The company has announced that it has partnered with popular RSS readers like Press, Reeder, gReader, Nextgen, and Newsify. This means Feedly users will be able to log in and import their news feeds to these applications. Google Reader was great because of the sheer number of applications that supported the service and it looks like Feedly is ready to become the de facto replacement for Google Reader.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feedly will also be focusing making its website and apps faster. The company said it has hired more developers to make sure it has the resources to provide a great experience. Windows 8 and Windows Phone support will be coming eventually as well.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Feedly v15</title>
            <description>Forget all the hassle of finding web content using social media, by far the simplest and most elegant solution when it comes to aggregating content from a wide variety of websites is RSS. And with Google exiting the market by canning its popular Google Reader service, third-party RSS services are rushing to fill the void.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feedly is one such provider, and transferring your carefully nurtured and organised feeds from Google Reader to Feedly – for free, of course – is a simple case of signing up with your Google Account. Bam, job done. Part of the reason for this simplicity is that Feedly itself relied on Google Reader feeds, but is migrating to its own backend prior to the Google switch-off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Feedly offers two ways of accessing, managing and adding RSS feeds across all your devices. Desktop and laptop users must install a tiny bookmarklet in a compatible web browser – Chrome, Firefox or Safari, but surprisingly not Internet Explorer – before it can be used.&lt;br /&gt;

<i>Newsblur imports all of your Google Reader feeds to get started and then works basically like Google's reader. The web interface is better than the very basic one in Google Reader and can be customized just like you want it.</i><br />

            <title>Digg RSS Reader May Not Be Free</title>
            <description>Digg is aiming to release a beta version of its RSS reader some time in June, ahead of the July 1 closing of Google Reader, but it may not be free.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After Google announced it would be shutting down its RSS reader back in March, Digg promised users it would build a new platform that could replace Google Reader. Digg has been working on the new service as its top priority, and this week it announced more details about what may be included in the reader. Digg also alluded to the fact that it will probably charge for its reader.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>PingIt Tailored RSS Feeds</title>
            <description>Ping.it launched initially in private beta back in December, before Google revealed it was pulling the plug on Reader. At its most basic level, Ping.it is an RSS reader. But it’s the new Probes feature that’s particularly interesting.&lt;br /&gt;

Pinterest is a highly visual virtual pinboard site that lets you&lt;i&gt; pin&lt;/i&gt; or collect images from the Web. You create boards to help you categorize your images and add descriptions to remind you why you bookmarked them in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS for Business</title>
            <description>RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a new way to broadcast corporate news and structured information. RSS offers a quick, easy corporate communication channel. The RSS contents are published as a feed and the feed&apos;s content keep customers, partners and journalists abreast of corporate news and information. The RSS feeds are read using a tool referred to as a news aggregator, or an RSS reader. The aggregator periodically checks to see if the RSS feed has been updated. As the feed is updated, new information will automatically appear in the RSS reader.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While RSS was at one point only considered to be a means to deliver news headlines, RSS has quickly become a powerful medium to disseminate all kinds of information. As traditional marketers are attempting to rein in content delivery, measuring e-mail open rates, click-throughs and conversions, Internet users are fighting to gain control over the content they receive. Savvy marketers and business owners are using RSS as a way to improve corporate communication and increase their external exposure and brand appeal.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Terror Can Breed Through Social Media</title>
            <description>The days of would-be terrorists needing to travel to far-off camps to make contacts and learn how to build bombs is rapidly receding. Social media forums like Twitter and Facebook provide a ready made Rolodex of sources -- dig further online, mine those contacts further, gain admission to private chat forums and eventually you will find instructions for bomb making.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Have you ever been watching ebay to find that rare item, or just trying to keep an eye out for a good deal?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You can save a search in ebay and it will email you daily, but I found that it leaves a lot to be desired.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It always gives me notification about suggested items that do not match my search.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Reddit and Criminal Crowd Sourcing</title>
            <description>Should the Internet hive-mind really be getting into the crime investigation business?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reddits crowdsourcing power often comes into conflict with its stated commitment to protecting online privacy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whereas Twitter and other kinds of social media are open firehoses of information, massive Internet forums like Reddit provide a community platform for dissecting information. At first blush, that might seem like a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>More on Google Reader</title>
            <description>Google Readers split from its loyal user base has been a tad messy. It is not you, it is us, Google implored.&lt;i&gt; We are living in a new kind of computing environment,&lt;/i&gt; was their attempt at letting users down gently.&lt;br /&gt;
However, for some die-hard fans it was all too much and they answered the only way they knew how – a selection of moderately funny internet memes and online petitions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the uninitiated, the search giant is set to shut down its RSS tool on July 1st; a service used daily by millions to gather together content from blogs, newswires and almost countless sites around the web.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>What is Pinging? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marketing your blog requires more than simply publishing new content -- you need to tell the world to update the content in your RSS feed by sending a ping message to subscribers, search engines, blog aggregators and update services. Configure your blog or podcast with an RSS feed channel and tell ping services to update your content.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why RSS Still Matters</title>
            <description>Just as with any major tech event, it spurred a raft of reactions on what is currently our best real-time conversation broadcasting network, Twitter. Reactions ranged from outrage to sadness to smugness — the latter epitomized by the camp who say that RSS was already a confusing mess that needed to be shot down completely and besides, it had been replaced by Twitter itself anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, no. RSS matters.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>New Feedly Features</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Here is what is new in the latest version of Feedly:<br />
<br />
The developers have fixed a login bug that forced users to login to the service regularly. According to Feedly, this should not happen anymore even if the servers are taxed to the limit.<br />
The title only view mode - my preferred mode of viewing RSS updates - has been improved. It now stretches across the whole width of the browser window automatically. While that is not entirely true, as you can see from the screenshot above, it is still an improvement. The title only view has also received more sharing options (while hovering over an article).<br />
Faster load times for the service. The developers have optimized the client code so that you should experience better performance while using the service.<br />
Support for folders that include&nbsp;&nbsp;[] brackets.<br />
Support for Hebrew and Farsi.<br />
Improved feed search to find feeds by URL and add them to your list of subscribed feeds.<br />
Feedly seems dedicated to improve the service and while many users are waiting for a web-based version of it, the improvements certainly are welcome additions to the service as well. <br />

            <description>Truncated feeds can be a bummer, especially if you really enjoy reading your favorite blogs via RSS. FeedsAPI is a service that will take any truncated RSS feed, expand it to a full-text feed, and then deliver the resulting stories directly to your inbox, or to your preferred news reader. Best of all, it does this in real-time, so you don&apos;t have to wait hours for stories to process.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Why Did Google Abandon RSS?</title>
            <description>When Google announced Reader, their RSS service, was being shuttered… news junkies everywhere revolted. Reader was the easiest, simplest, cleanest RSS feed available. Everyone wondered why it was being shut down, and a groundswell of support was initiated to bring it back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There has been no sign of Google reversing their &lt;i&gt;spring cleaning&lt;/i&gt; initiative, but it is really hard to believe they would simply abandon RSS altogether.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>You have probably been searching for the best free RSS readers ever since Mountain View struck down with the news about not supporting the Google-branded one starting from July 2013. The company may have cited declining usage as one of the reasons for shutting shop on this front, but that was no consolation for people like us who were thrown into panic on hearing about the imminent demise of the service. So if you’re switching from Google’s syndication service or any other similar tool, here are some good options in no particular order -&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
However, times may not be terrible for the people that still regularly use RSS readers, as Digg has said they are building a Google Reader replacement and they believe it will be ready before Google axe Reader on July 1 2013.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Google Removes RSS Support From Chrome</title>
            <description>Google Reader is not the only RSS product to be getting the ax at Google. The RSS extension for Googles Chrome Web browser has also been cut, which means that Chrome users can no longer use it to quickly subscribe to RSS feeds as they browse the Web.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>RSS to Email for Bloggers</title>
            <description>With Google Reader being abandoned millions of bloggers are left to figure out a way to keep their content in front of their readers, hoping they are tech-savvy and interested enough to transfer their feeds to another service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, email marketing service Mad Mimi offers an effective alternative. An RSS to Email feature allows businesses and bloggers to share their content with subscribers and maintain control of their distributions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RSS to Email automatically converts blog posts into the form of an email for subscribers. The blogger uses a webform to collect email addresses. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Future of RSS</title>
            <description>Todays world is filled with massive amounts of information. According to IBM, 90% of todays existing data has been created in just the past two years. People no longer sit down at their desktop and surf the web for an hour a day. Instead, they are constantly creating, searching for information, and retrieving content from all types of devices – smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and laptops. As these digital technologies continue to evolve and move in a more mobile direction, new opportunities arise for technologies like RSS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hot new mobile applications like Flipboard provide a great example of how RSS feeds can be leveraged to bring updated digital content to customers. Flipboard &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How Charities Can Make Better Use of Social Media</title>
            <description>Social media is an increasingly effective strategy for charities that want to connect with supporters. A recent survey showed that UK charitable organisations have doubled their supporters on key social media channels in the past year. Yet, for many charities, the vastness of the social media landscape is too daunting to venture into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At The Clare Foundation, we encourage tenants at our Buckinghamshire charity centre to take advantage of all the opportunities that social media channels offer. Our approach is to encourage charitable organisations to bring established commercial methods, business expertise and entrepreneurism to the voluntary sector. Maximising the effectiveness of social media is one area in which many charities need to catch up with commercial businesses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charities rely on public support and so need to find new ways to reach their supporters, potential donors and volunteers. Social media can be one of the most effective ways for charities to build supporters, boost donations, share success stories, network with like-minded organisations, encourage people to sign up to campaigns, recruit volunteers, or demonstrate the impact of their work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Businesses Benefit from Listening to Social Media</title>
            <description>When many financial advisers ask their firms about fully engaging in social media, the answer is usually still a resolute &quot;no&quot; - to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Pinterest, blogging and just about anything else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only a few of the major financial firms, including Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, have started pilot programs to give their financial advisers access to social media, because each interaction has to be monitored by a compliance system to make sure advisers are abiding by regulations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Advisers themselves aren&apos;t convinced that there&apos;s enough value for their practices in using social media. Only 19 percent of the 463 financial advisers surveyed by Aite Group, a research firm based in Boston, said they found social media to be useful to their businesses. LinkedIn use was up 10 percent since 2009, but professional use of Facebook and Twitter dropped 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, and blogging was down 9 percent, according to the Aite study.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Keeping track of the many social networks you are a member of can certainly be a challenging task. Between Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram, Flickr, and more, we all probably have at least two or three accounts that we check on a daily basis.

If you have an opportunity to work this technique into your content marketing strategy, it can be extremely effective at creating traffic and interest in your brand, as well as giving you another option for your writing. To be successful at newsjacking though, there are a number of aspects that you’ll need to prepare and consider.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Interesting Thoughts on Protecting Content</title>
            <description>One of the annoyances of publishing original content online is when Google chooses to return a copy of your work from another website before your original in its search results pages. Googles traffic is money for website publishers, as more readers can mean more money from ad revenue. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What Do You Want from a Tech Podcast?</title>
            <description>If you subscribe to podcasts on a regular basis, you’ve discovered there is no shortage of formats. Some are published daily, some are published weekly. Some feature a solitary host, while others entertain a rotating panel of guests. Some episodes clock in at only 5 minutes, while others frequently break the 2 hour barrier. And when it comes to content, the sky is the limit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Assuming you have room on your subscription list for another podcast focused on technology and gadgets, what would you expect from it?&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Samsung Electronics Co. is succeeding where other technology companies have tried and failed: closing the coolness gap with Apple Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The deep-pocketed Korean company has used a combination of engineering prowess, manufacturing heft and marketing savvy to create smartphones that can rival the iPhone in both sales and appeal.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Apple Is Not a Bellwether</title>
            <description>The rise of Apple shares over the last few years was meteoric. Their fall over last few days has been traumatic. But these gyrations may not matter much to the overall stock market.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They will matter, of course, if you lost money as Apple dropped from $702 in September to $439.88 on Friday. And the companys struggles may be of more than passing interest even if you never intend to own any of its shares.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Apple remains a colossus, even if Exxon Mobil surpassed it as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world on Friday, exactly one year after iPhone sales propelled Apple to the top spot. Still, all of those iPhones, iPads and other gadgets make Apple matter in many households.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Internet Over Sharing</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Mothers-to-be may be divulging too much pregnancy information on social media, a survey suggests.<br />
<br />
Two in five people believe that pregnant women overshare details on websites such as Facebook, according to a poll by Netmums and the Department of Healths Start4Life campaign.<br />
<br />
Nine in 10 of those surveyed said they had seen an image online of a friend's scan and 22% said they had viewed a photo of a positive pregnancy test.<br />
<br />
More than two thirds of people felt that mothers-to-be were more likely to try to show a <i>perfect </i>pregnancy than a realistic one, according to the survey of 2,000 Netmums members who use Facebook.<br />
<br />
And 62% said they felt friends were more likely to talk about trivial aspects of their pregnancy rather than important matters such as their health.<br />

            <title>Social Adoption</title>
            <description>A survey of 600 small business owners across the United States indicates that 90% are actively engaged in social networking sites, reported Social Media Today, and 74% perceive social networking as valuable if not more valuable than networking in-person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pretty startling statistics for social adoption!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Social Media Quick to Judge, Slow to Absolve</title>
            <description>Though much of the story surrounding Friday&apos;s horrific massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., remains mystifying, one thing is clear: Ryan Lanza is not the shooter. Contrary to early reports from officials, the shooter has now been identified as Lanza&apos;s brother, Adam, now counted among the dead, along with their mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But for several hours, the name Ryan Lanza was synonymous with the heinous killing spree, and a jury of Internet denizens had him condemned as a murderer. And why not? All of the major news outlets had declared it so, citing a credible source, and Lanzas name blazed in headlines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Almost immediately, websites — homing in on a publicly viewable Facebook profile — took screen grabs of the page to illustrate news stories, identifying him as the deceased killer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Social Time Suck</title>
            <description>According to Nielsens 2012 Social Media Report released this week, Americans spent 121 billion minutes on social networking sites between July 2011 and July 2012, up from 88 billion the previous year. Apps captured a large portion of those minutes, accounting for a third of overall social networking time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The percentage of time Americans spent on social networking sites rose 37 percent to 121 billion minutes in the last year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Facebook topped the list of most-visited social networks, as expected, but time spent on Pinterest’s website increased by more than 1000 percent year-over-year. Google+, Tumblr, and Twitter are also growing in popularity, and sucking away more of your time.&lt;br /&gt;

All the techniques with internet marketing are available to anyone who chooses to use them, but it is interesting that they do not all use them with the same degree of proficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is not hard to give you many examples of this; one minute cure is such an example because it is popular. You can take a thousand people all using the same group of methods, and you know what will happen in terms of how well they do.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Track Your WordPress Feed Stats</title>
            <description>Available free in the WordPress repository, the &lt;i&gt;Feed Statistics&lt;/i&gt; plugin for WordPress gives you stats based on your native WP feed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only thing you really have to know about it is that, like all statistic options, it’s data is inaccurate for the first couple days. In fact, this is the type of plugin that probably should run a good 30 days before you really dig into the data it provides.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
HootSuite launched all the way back in 2008, allowing users to manage their multiple social networks through one, easy-to-use dashboard. Since then, HootSuite has grown into a global social media brand used by individuals, companies, you name it. The dashboards services continue to grow, adding the above apps to the directory after releasing its Engagement API earlier this year. At that time, HootSuite attracted Digg, Trendspottr, Instagram, and SlideShare to its App Directory.</description>

            <title>FeedBurner Stat Issues</title>
            <description>Feed stats, one of FeedBurners main features, is currently broken, and Google quietly wrote a shutdown notice for the API. FeedBurner is a product that has been neglected by Google over the years. Yet, as the dominant product to manage RSS feeds, many developers count on it and expect it to be reliable. The future of the service remains unsure and a service shutdown is not out of the equation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
FeedBurner, which was acquired by Google for $100 million in 2007, was not part of the latest round of shutdowns announced by Google. &lt;i&gt;We have no news to announce at this time,&lt;/i&gt; said a Google spokesperson to TechCrunch today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mobilizing the Web of Feeds</title>
            <description>While the news that Twitter will no longer support RSS was not really surprising, it was a bit annoying. It served as yet another reminder that the Twitter-as-open-message-utility idea that many early adopters of the service loved was in fact going away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are already several projects intending to disrupt Twitter, mostly focused on the idea of a distributed, federated messaging standard and/or platform. But we already have such a service: an open standard adopted by millions of sources; a federated network of all kinds of interesting, useful and entertaining data feeds published in real-time. It is called RSS.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>AdSense for RSS Feeds Gets the Axe</title>
            <description>As part of its latest round of &lt;i&gt;spring cleaning, &lt;/i&gt;Google just announced that it is shuttering AdSense for Feeds. The service, which allows publishers to earn a bit of extra revenue by adding Googles ads to their RSS feeds, will be retired on October 2 and will close on December 3. Given that Feedburner has long been expected to be on one of Googles next spring cleaning lists, it does not come as a surprise that the company is now shutting down the only way it was actually making money from the product.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Podcast Sermons</title>
            <description>The Internet has made spreading faith significantly easier. In the past, community residents were limited to the churches, temples and houses of worships that were available within driving distances. Coordinating schedules with sermons could be challenging for busy families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Internet has opened the doors to a diverse congregation that exists beyond the traditional borders that communities have become accustom to. Using technology as a communication medium has not been lost on spiritual leaders and many have embraced the Internet as a medium to spread their faith. It is rare to find a house of worship that does not have a website or Internet presense. Expanding upon this theme, parishes looked to podcasting to further expanded the reach of their spiritual counselors and ministers. Many preachers record homilies, hymns, services, sermons or gospel teachings, for parishioners and interested listeners.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Podcasting allows followers to listen to mass or sermons on their way to work or at a time and place of their choosing. Integrating technology into spiritual messages has become a modern solution to chaotic schedules in an online world.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Reputation Management</title>
            <description>The Internet is a bit like the old wild west, and sadly, people often post material about an individual, product, company, or service that is inaccurate or simply nasty. Businesses and individuals alike are struggling with how to best deal with online inaccuracy and defamation. The normal steps for dealing with defamation typically involve litigation, but this is not always realistic for Internet-based situations since the Internet is global, and not managed or governed by any single set of laws.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you have the good fortune of being located in the same legal jurisdiction as the offending poster and their website hosting company, you might be able to successfully prosecute them; or at the very least, you might be able to get the webpage with the offending material taken down by the website host. Keep in mind that most defamation court cases require that you show that actual harm was done by the offending material, which can often be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
